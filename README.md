Technologies Used:

HTML: All text, links and images were applied through CSS

CSS- I worked on custom buttons and borders for my page to familiarize myself with the tools availible is css.  The alaignment of the sections was essential for resizing the page and making it mobile firendly(ish)

JS-
    -Carousel-
    The carousel was simply a demonstration and could modified for future projects added.
    -Hide/Reveal-  This was utilized so that I could have everything on one page but highlight the sections individually.
    -Modal  I utilized the Modal as a point of contact and attention getter.


Approach taken:  First I made a wireframe of how I thought the sections would be layed out and made a visual to share with my lead(Joy).  After that I built out the HTML and got an idea of how my headers, buttons and content would be organized.  After that I started to pretty things up with CSS.  As the JQuery functions were built I alter the CSS to compliment.

Installation instructions:  Open the Link? (is there more to this?)


Unsolved problems: 

    -When the buttons are resized to a small screen I had a hard time making them line up. 

    -The background for the modal only covers the upper part of the screen.

    -When the buttons are clicked and the hidden sections are revealed the page scrolls down.  would be great if they stayed ancored at the top of page.
